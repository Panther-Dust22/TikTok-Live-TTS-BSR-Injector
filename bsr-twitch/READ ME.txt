Place this folder wherever you like, create a shortcut to the index file and place with your streaming programs so they are all together, name it (the shortcut) whatever you like.

Make sure you have TikFinity and BeatsaberPlus installed

Launch Tikfinity

open the web page using either your shortcut or the index file.

on the left pane click connect, you should get a green tick

On the right pane click the link to get your Oauth code

tick the box to allow you to enter your details

click generate and copy the code given into the bsr Injector page without the "Oauth:" (just numbers and letters)

in the username box, enter your Twitch username (last part of the web address to your page twitch.tv/YOURUSERNAME)

put this same name in the Channel box and then press save

refresh the page, the left side should auto connect and on the right just tick the box.

Your all done, all messages will be passed from TikTok to Twitch to be picked up by BS+.

the !open and !close queue commands can ONLY be used my moderators, this is codded into my script so no need to change anything else, all song requests made will be auto added to your queue as long as its open and the requester will be named (hover over a song to see who requested it) users can find songs at beatsaver.com, they can copy the code using the twitch icon and paste it into your TikTok chat but they MUST remove the "!" (explanation mark) at the front for it to work, some codes get blocked by a the TikTok filter, a user just needs to add a word beside it for it to send, for example "bsr 76e4r potato".

Enjoy
