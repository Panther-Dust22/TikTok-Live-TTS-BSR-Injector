             \*\*..................Why did we make this?...............…\*\*





Originally Emstar wanted to be able to accept bsr codes in Beatsaber while streaming on TikTok,

she asked and begged and annoyed her Husband until he gave in and built a bypass,

program that passes all messages from TikTok to Twitch, this started off in Streamer.Bot

it worked but it was unreliable so he built a version 2 using an internet browser and some JS

then she discovered TTS and wanted her own, so using some code found online he built one for her

this was version 2, then with some tweaks and added extras like more voices, mod commands and so on

he built version 2.5 and released it to everyone on GitHub.



Not being happy with editing txt files to change settings and the complexity of the setup,

the people began to form a mob with pitchforks and fire, they would scream and shout for an update,

but not as loud as Emstar, so he created v3 that didn't get to see a release, that cleaned up the

setup process and the settings issue, Emstar was silenced but the people still roared for an update.



with a week to spare and a laptop strapped to his face Husband began to code, hours went past,

slowly turning to days, and then a week had arrived, with a test stream behind him and bugs

found that needed to be squashed he set aside a couple extra days and

handcuffed himself to the sofa and laptop.



2 days pass with 2 and 3AM bed times and it was finally here, with the next day spent tweaking,

Version 4, a complete overhaul, A rustic user interface, automatic moderator commands, simple,

elegant, idiot proof, a shining beacon of what someone that cant code for shit can do, turning no skill into....

In the GUI are all the buttons, bells and whistles (voices) that you could need.

5th row is my information bar, shows next planned update and gives a link to our discord



HAVE FUN!



Pre-release updates: I had trouble trying to get python 12 to be dominant, this caused a massive pain with people having newer versions of python installed on their systems, as it kept trying to take over, I have now made all calls and scripts target python 3.12 so no more broken path issues or missing requirements, installer updated to create a shortcut for you, other small bugs squashed, and performance improvements, we should see a lot less crashing now because of some other fixes.
