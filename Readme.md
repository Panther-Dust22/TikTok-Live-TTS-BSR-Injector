Version 5 Update available here https://github.com/Panther-Dust22/TikTok-Live-TTS

We have decided to split the BSR injector and TTS into 2 projects,  
this was because the BSR injector is now built into Beatsaver using a plugin available here https://github.com/Panther-Dust22/TikTok-Beatsaber-bsr-Injector

and because the TTS system got a bit complex so i didnt want to have people updating everything if they only needed one or the other.

This Git has been archived for Historical use and for the message updates in both systems, old versions are available on the releases list
